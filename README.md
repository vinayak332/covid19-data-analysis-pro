# COVID-19 Data Analysis Project

## ðŸ“Œ Overview
This project performs an end-to-end **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** on the COVID-19 dataset from [Our World in Data](https://ourworldindata.org/covid-deaths).  
The analysis focuses on trends in **cases, deaths, and vaccinations** across different countries.

## ðŸ“‚ Project Structure
- `data/` â†’ Dataset file  
- `notebooks/` â†’ Jupyter notebooks with detailed analysis  
- `scripts/` â†’ Python scripts for modular code  
- `visuals/` â†’ Graphs & charts generated from analysis  
- `requirements.txt` â†’ Python dependencies  

## ðŸ”§ Tools & Libraries
- Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
- Jupyter Notebook
- Data visualization & storytelling techniques

## ðŸ“Š Key Insights
- The United States, India, and Brazil recorded the highest total cases.  
- When normalized by population, smaller countries like Gibraltar and Andorra show higher per capita rates.  
- Vaccination progress is strongly correlated with reduction in deaths.

## ðŸš€ Future Work
- Implement predictive modeling with ARIMA or Facebook Prophet.  
- Build interactive dashboards using Plotly Dash / Power BI.  
- Extend to other public health datasets for comparative studies.
